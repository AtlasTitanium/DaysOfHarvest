# DaysOfHarvest
***Stories of Days Past***
In the year 2043 several meteorites crashed into earth, a year later the meteorites cracked open and started emitting energies which started to affect people and turning them into what would later be known as ‘Infected’. This event was named ‘The Dusk’.

After the Dusk the remaining unaffected humans retreated into dome cities to keep the infected and the meteorite energy at bay. These Domes are far apart and any travel between them requires wearing a protective energy shield to prevent getting infected. There are those who live outside the domes that protect their camp with makeshift energy shields around their territory.

There is an organization known as Floweret, who seeks to figure out the mysteries behind the Dusk and the meteorites. They have several institutes dedicated to picking apart these mysteries and formulating a cure. These institutes started experimenting on unborn children, those who weren’t born stillborn where quickly perceived to not only be immune to the infection but also have powers because of the energy they’ve been exposed to, they were dubbed as the ‘Exempt’

The exempt are a well kept secret and the dome cities have no hard evidence they exist, only high ranking politicians who fund Floweret know of them. The ones that manage to escape the facilities isolate themselves and live far away from both dome cities and the facility they come from. There is a small camp where exempt try to live their live in relative peace.

***Exempt***
Humans who have been exposed to energy from the crystal meteorites since they were conceived, they are immune to the infection but infected can sense them and almost instinctively seek them out and they also all have powers based on the kind of energy meteorite they’ve been exposed to.

Infected
These former humans were affected by the strange energies from the crystal meteorites.
Infected come in 4 different types; Light, Gravity, Solar and Void. Each type has different abilities but what they all have in common are that they all have 3 stages to their infections, they can sense things that give of similar energies as themselves (Crystal meteorites, Exempt) and that they can infect humans by; biting, scratching or prolonged unprotected exposure. In early stages Infected still retain intelligence but in later stages of their infection it diminishes until it’s barely there, they trade abilities for intelligence

Light
Known as Lumen
In their 2th stage they start to develop their invisibility (They cannot use this ability long so they will mostly just flicker) 
In their 3th stage they can create small illusions around them
These abilities makes them dangerous, especially those that regained some intelligence
Gravity
Known as Pondus
In their 2th stage Pondus can slightly increase and decrease gravity in about a radius of 2 meters around them
In their 3th stage they can change their own personal gravity which allows them the float on the ceilings, so don’t forget to look up every once in a while.
Solar
Known as Ignis
In their 2th stage Ignis gain the ability for energy blasts. At first they can only blast energy from the most infected parts of their body and in later stages they create a large blast radius originating from their whole body.
In their 3th stage they gain energy conversion, they can any force but on their body and release it later (think Black panther suit)
Void
Known as Umbra
In their 2th stage they gain shielding abilities, they can however only create smaller shields and only around themselves.
In their 3th stage Umbra get teleportation abilities and they can now create a large bubble around themselves and, if they’re intelligent enough, around other infected.
They also gain Intangibility in their 3th stage but they activate it randomly as they don’t appear to have any control on it.
Umbra also gain the ability to shapeshift in their 3th stage, however none are intelligent enough to use this ability fully, so sometimes you may see an idle Umbra shapeshift their arm or head into something more human (People speculate they unconsciously try to return to their original human form but some Umbra are seen shifting their face into multiple other human faces.)
