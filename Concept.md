# Concept
A Survival farming game where the player is in a post apocalyptic world ravished by zombie-like monsters. The player's goal is to build a successful farm and home where they can sustain themselves in this world, all while fighting off any infected that intent to harm them or their farm.


## The Player:
The character that the player controls has abilities similar to the monsters, they can't be 'infected' by the zombies but can be killed and the longer they stay in one place or use their abilities the more zombies will appear.

As it is a survival game the player will have a tiredness and hunger meter that deplete slowly when idle and can be replenished by sleeping and eating or drinking.

The player can die if they are hungry and tired for too long or a killed by a zombie or large animal.
Surroundings/The Map:
The world the player will walk around in is mostly forrest with more hills on the edges of the map. It is not a small map but not Fallout levels of big either. The player is free to explore this map but when starting the game the idea is to find a place to settle as fast as possible.

The player can 'settle' anywhere on the map that has a somewhat flat surface. Not every area is fertile or has more monsters so the player might decide to pack up and move on to another area.

On the map are places where you can find seeds and farm wood and rock to expand your settlement and make it bigger and safer to stay.



## Settlement
The player can 'settle' anywhere on the map that has a somewhat flat surface. Not every area is fertile or has more monsters so the player might decide to pack up and move on to another area.

The Settlement will start off as a small tent where the player can sleep in. With materials like wood the player can build a small shack that can later be expanded and improved. With other materials other objects like flower beds and equipment chests can be build as well as objects to decorate the settlement.

Protecting the settlement is very important too, the player can't always be around to fight of any zombies that threaten the settlement but can build fences, spikes and traps around the settlement to slow down or kill any zombies.

The player can abandon a settlement if they so choose, this is easiest in the early stages when it's just the tent, They are allowed to 'pack up' the tent and move on. However any large structure cannot be moved and will be left behind if the player leaves the settlement to find a new one. Smaller objects like flower beds and decorations can be taken with the player but only if they build a cart to store them in.
